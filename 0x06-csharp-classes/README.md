## 0. Braaainsss
Create a new namespace ```Enemies```. Create an empty public class ```Zombie``` within ```Enemies``` that defines a zombie.

## 1. Healthy competition
Based on ```0-enemy```, write a public class ```Zombie``` that defines a zombie by:

* public field ```health```
* ```health``` should be an int and have no value
* public constructor: ```public Zombie()```
    * sets the value of ```health``` to ```0```

## 2. Health validation
Based on ```1-enemy```, write a public class ```Zombie``` that defines a zombie by:

* public field ```health```
* ```health``` should be an int and have no value
* public constructor: ```public Zombie()```
    * sets the value of ```health``` to ```0```
* a new public constructor: ```public Zombie(int value)```
    * ```value``` must be greater than or equal to 0
    * if ```value``` is less than 0, throw an ```ArgumentException``` with the message ```Health must be greater than or equal to 0```

## 3. Zombie health
Based on ```2-enemy```, write a public class ```Zombie``` that defines a zombie by:

* private field ```health```
* ```health``` should be an int and have no value
* public constructor: ```public Zombie()```
    * sets the value of ```health``` to ```0```
* public constructor: ```public Zombie(int value)```
    * ```value``` must be greater than or equal to 0
* public method ```public int GetHealth()``` that returns the value of health of the Zombie object
     
## 4. Hello, my name is
Based on ```3-enemy```, write a public class ```Zombie``` that defines a zombie by:

* private field ```health```
* ```health``` should be an int and have no value
* public constructor: ```public Zombie()```
    * sets the value of ```health``` to ```0```
* public constructor: ```public Zombie(int value)```
    * ```value``` must be greater than or equal to 0
* private field ```name```
* ```name``` should be a string and have a default value of ```(No name)```
* public property ```Name```
    * ```get```: retrieve name
    * ```set```: set name
* public method ```public int GetHealth()``` that returns the value of health of the Zombie object

## 5. Printing a zombie
Based on ```4-enemy```, write a public class ```Zombie``` that defines a zombie by:

* private field ```health```
* ```health``` should be an int and have no value
* public constructor: ```public Zombie()```
    * sets the value of ```health``` to ```0```
* public constructor: ```public Zombie(int value)```
    * ```value``` must be greater than or equal to 0
* private field ```name```
* ```name``` should be a string and have a default value of ```(No name)```
* public property ```Name```
    * ```get```: retrieve name
    * ```set```: set name
* public method ```public int GetHealth()``` that returns the value of health of the Zombie object
* public ```.toString()``` override that prints the Zombie object’s attributes to stdout
    * Format: ```Zombie name: <name> / Total Health: <health>``` (see example below)
